# My JAVA Workbook

This repository contains every single bit of code I have ever written myself and more. With that in mind, I can observe my progression in learning JAVA. 

I keep an [alpha](https://github.com/adamkpl/JavaWorkbook/tree/alpha) branch where I break things, hence the code may not compile at all, but you can check out what's cookin' ;) 

Keep in mind -- this is a **workbook**, so everything here is a work-in-progress, incomplete, and/or designed to throw exceptions that are not addressed. I treat it as a cheat sheet for myself.

You should take a look at the account's main page for other repositories where I (try to) keep final versions of code e.g [SeleniumTests](https://github.com/adamkpl/SeleniumTests).
