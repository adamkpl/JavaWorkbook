# My JAVA Workbook

This repository contains every single bit of code I have ever written myself and more. With that in mind, I can observe my progression in learning JAVA. 

I keep an [alpha](https://github.com/adamkpl/JavaWorkbook/tree/alpha) branch where I break things, hence the code may not compile at all. 

This is a **WORKBOOK**, hence everything here is a work-in-progress, incomplete, and/or designed to throw exceptions that are not addressed.
