# My JAVA Workbook

This repository contains every single bit of code I have ever written myself. With that in mind, I can observe my progression in learning JAVA. 

I occasionally keep branches, so you can check out what's cookin' ;) 

Currently there is an 'alpha' branch where I started implementing Domain/Page Object Pattern (Fluent API).
